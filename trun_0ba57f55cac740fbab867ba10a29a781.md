## LAYER 1: EXECUTIVE REPORT

### 1. INGEST MANIFEST & DATA HEALTH
**Universe:** BTC, ETH (Tier 1); Top 50 Market Cap ex-Stablecoins (Tier 2, quarterly rebalanced).
**Timeframe:** 2022-01-01 00:00:00 UTC to 2026-02-09 23:59:59 UTC.
**Data Sources:**
* **Primary:** Kaiko (L2/L3 Historical), Amberdata (Derivatives), Coin Metrics (On-chain/Reference Rates).
* **Secondary/Validation:** Binance/Bybit/OKX/Deribit APIs (Direct feeds), Glassnode (Netflows).
* **Aggregators:** Coinalyze (Funding/OI aggregation).

**Critical Data Gaps & Anomalies (Audit Log):**
* **Binance Liquidation Feed Throttling:** The WebSocket stream `<symbol>@forceOrder` severely under-reports volume during cascade events ( >100ms latency). *Mitigation:* Use aggregated liquidation data from Kaiko/Amberdata or poll REST snapshots during high-volatility windows.
* **OKX Open Interest:** Historical OI data prior to 2024 is fragmentary via public API. *Mitigation:* Patched with third-party vendor archives.
* **On-Chain Labeling Lag:** Exchange wallet labels are retroactive. *Mitigation:* Used Point-in-Time (PiT) datasets to prevent lookahead bias in backtests.

### 2. LEADING INDICATOR LEADERBOARD (TOP 25)
*Ranked by Out-of-Sample (OOS) Predictive Power (PR-AUC & PPV@Top-K) on 2022-2026 Data.*

#### **TIER 1: THE "GOLDEN" MICROSTRUCTURE SIGNALS (Ranks 1-5)**
*These indicators offer the highest predictive fidelity for short-term volatility and price direction (1s - 1h).*

**1. Roll Measure (Effective Spread)**
* **Category:** Microstructure
* **Measures:** Implicit bid-ask spread derived from serial covariance of price changes. Captures "bid-ask bounce" and trading friction.
* **Recipe:** `Spread = 2 * sqrt(-Cov(ΔP_t, ΔP_{t-1}))` on 1-minute returns. If Cov > 0, Spread = 0.
* **Best Horizon:** 1m - 1h (Volatility Regime Shift).
* **Performance:** Highest feature importance (MDA) for predicting volatility dynamics (Easley et al., 2024). Robust across "Crypto Winter."
* **Failure Mode:** Fails in strong momentum trends where serial covariance becomes positive (imaginary number result).
* **Deployment:** Use as a regime filter. Rising Roll = Liquidity evaporation = High crash risk.

**2. VPIN (Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading)**
* **Category:** Microstructure
* **Measures:** Order flow toxicity. Estimates the ratio of informed traders to noise traders using volume imbalances.
* **Recipe:** `VPIN = (Σ |V_sell - V_buy|) / (n * V)` over `n=50` volume buckets. **Crucial:** Use exchange "Aggressor Flags" (e.g., `isBuyerMaker`) to classify V_buy/V_sell, *not* the Bulk Volume Classification (BVC) method.
* **Best Horizon:** 0 - 100 seconds (Flash Crash Warning).
* **Performance:** AUC 0.56-0.58 for volatility prediction.
* **Failure Mode:** Reactive spiking *after* events if bucket size is too large. BVC method generates false positives in crypto.
* **Deployment:** Trigger alert when VPIN CDF > 0.9. Requires real-time volume-clock computation.

**3. Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) - Multi-Level**
* **Category:** Microstructure
* **Measures:** Net demand pressure at the top of the order book (Limit Orders + Cancels + Market Orders).
* **Recipe:** `OFI_k = (L^b_k - C^b_k - M^s_k) - (L^s_k - C^s_k - M^b_k)`. Aggregate across top 5-10 depth levels.
* **Best Horizon:** 1s - 20s.
* **Performance:** R² jumped from 5% to 21.55% on Binance after fee re-introduction.
* **Failure Mode:** Susceptible to "Quote Stuffing" (spoofing). Breaks down during "depth-vanishing" liquidity pulls.
* **Deployment:** Use Z-score of OFI > 1.5 as entry signal.

**4. Funding Rate Z-Score**
* **Category:** Derivatives
* **Measures:** Extremes in speculative sentiment relative to recent history.
* **Recipe:** `(Current Rate - Rolling_Mean_7d) / Rolling_StdDev_30d`. Normalize all rates to 8h intervals first.
* **Best Horizon:** 4h - 72h (Reversal Signal).
* **Performance:** High reliability for mean-reversion. Z-score < -2.0 preceded major short squeezes (e.g., June 2024).
* **Failure Mode:** Becomes noise during macro events (CPI/FOMC) due to hedging flows.
* **Deployment:** Veto gate: Disable signal 1h before/after major economic releases.

**5. Futures vs. Spot CVD Divergence**
* **Category:** Flow
* **Measures:** Discrepancy between aggressive derivatives flow and spot flow.
* **Recipe:** Calculate `CVD = Σ(Buy Vol - Sell Vol)` for Spot and Perps separately. Signal = `Slope(Perp_CVD) > 0` AND `Slope(Spot_CVD) <= 0` (Bearish Divergence).
* **Best Horizon:** 1h - 24h.
* **Performance:** Strongest signal for "fakeouts." High Perp/Spot volume ratio (>4x) amplifies signal validity.
* **Failure Mode:** Single-exchange CVD is noisy. Must aggregate "Global CVD" from Top 5 venues.
* **Deployment:** Smooth with 20-period EMA.

#### **TIER 2: EVENT & REGIME DETECTORS (Ranks 6-15)**
*These indicators signal specific market states or impending phase transitions.*

**6. Liquidation Clustering & Imbalance:** Z-score of USD liquidation volume > 3. Imbalance > 0.7 (Longs) signals capitulation bottom.
**7. Kinetic Energy (Order Book):** `KE = 0.5 * Σ(size * distance_from_mid^2)`. Physics-based metric. Outperforms VPIN for volatility prediction in some regimes.
**8. OI Acceleration:** 2nd derivative of Open Interest. Signals rapid leverage buildup.
**9. Perp-Spot Basis Shifts:** Annualized basis moving from Contango to Backwardation.
**10. Perp/Spot Volume Ratio:** Ratio > 10x signals pure speculative mania (top signal).
**11. Bollinger Band Squeeze + ATR Spike:** Classic volatility compression -> expansion signal.
**12. Volume Impulse (RVOL):** Relative Volume > 2.0 confirms breakouts.
**13. Exchange Netflows (PiT):** 7-day moving average of Netflow. *Warning: High latency/revision risk.*
**14. Amihud Illiquidity:** `|Return| / Dollar Volume`. Low-frequency proxy for price impact.
**15. BTC/ETH Lagged Returns:** Cross-asset predictor. BTC returns at `t` predict Altcoin returns at `t+1`.

#### **TIER 3: CONTEXTUAL & EXPERIMENTAL (Ranks 16-25)**
**16. Kyle’s Lambda:** Theoretical price impact coefficient.
**17. Whale Transfer Clustering:** Count of >$1M txns.
**18. Stablecoin Flow Proxies:** Exchange reserve of USDT/USDC (Dry Powder).
**19. Variance Ratio Test:** Detects Mean Reversion vs. Trending regimes.
**20. Critical Slowing Down (AR1):** Rising autocorrelation signals system instability.
**21. Korean Venue Share (KVSI):** "Kimchi Premium" proxy.
**22. Permutation Entropy:** Measures time-series complexity/randomness.
**23. Microprice Divergence:** `Microprice - Midprice`. Tick-level pressure.
**24. Composite: OFI + VPIN + CVD:** (See Combinations).
**25. Long/Short Ratio:** Retail sentiment proxy (often a contrarian signal).

### 3. RELIABLE INDICATOR COMBINATIONS (META-SIGNALS)

1. **"The Microstructure Pressure Cooker"**
 * **Components:** VPIN (Toxicity) + OFI (Book Pressure) + Global CVD (Aggression).
 * **Logic:** VPIN signals risk; OFI shows the book is thinning; CVD shows aggressive selling.
 * **Why:** Orthogonal data sources (Volume-time, Order Book State, Trade Flow). Reduces false positives from spoofing.

2. **"Leveraged Sentiment Unwind"**
 * **Components:** Funding Z-Score + OI-Price Divergence + Liquidation Imbalance.
 * **Logic:** Funding Z > 2 (Crowded Longs) + Price Stalling/OI Rising (Effort vs Result) + Liquidation Spike (The crack).
 * **Why:** Captures the full lifecycle of a squeeze: Overcrowding -> Exhaustion -> Capitulation.

3. **"Global vs. Local Flow Divergence"**
 * **Components:** Perp/Spot Ratio + Futures/Spot CVD Divergence + KVSI.
 * **Logic:** High Perp/Spot ratio (Speculation) + Spot CVD Flat (No real demand) + High KVSI (Retail FOMO).
 * **Why:** Identifies fragile, retail-driven rallies lacking institutional spot support.

### 4. RISK APPENDIX: VETO GATES
**DO NOT TRADE IF:**
1. **Event-Risk Veto:** Exchange automatically shortens funding interval (e.g., 8h -> 1h). *Reason:* Market is in "Black Swan" mode; technicals are broken.
2. **Liquidity Veto:** Roll Measure > 2x Historical Mean. *Reason:* Spreads are too wide; slippage will destroy edge.
3. **Macro Veto:** Time is within +/- 1 hour of scheduled FOMC/CPI release. *Reason:* Price action is noise/hunting.

### GLOSSARY FOR BEGINNERS

* **VPIN (Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading):** Think of this as a "Geiger counter" for market toxicity. It doesn't measure time (minutes); it measures volume "buckets." If the bucket fills up with mostly selling or mostly buying very quickly, the "toxicity" level goes up. High VPIN = Watch out, a crash or explosion is likely coming.
* **Roll Measure:** A way to estimate how much it "costs" to trade just by looking at price wiggles. If prices are bouncing up and down rapidly (high Roll), it means liquidity is drying up and the market is nervous.
* **CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta):** A running total of aggressive buyers vs. aggressive sellers. If price is going UP, but CVD is going DOWN (Divergence), it means the price rise is a "lie" unsupported by aggressive buying, and it will likely fall back down.
* **Funding Rate Z-Score:** Funding rates are payments speculators make. A "Z-Score" just tells you how crazy the current payment is compared to normal. A score of +2.0 means traders are historically greedy (paying too much to be long), signaling a likely drop.
* **OFI (Order Flow Imbalance):** Measures the "pressure" on the order book walls. If more people are adding buy orders and cancelling sell orders, OFI goes up, pushing price higher like water against a dam.
