# 7-Day Preventive Medicine Playbook: Nail 2025 Guideline Shifts

## Executive Summary

For the USMLE Step 2 CK, the high-yield ground has shifted significantly in the last 12-24 months. Success requires unlearning outdated heuristics (e.g., "Colonoscopy at 50") and mastering the new, aggressive screening and immunization baselines established by the USPSTF and ACIP.

### Critical Guideline Shifts Defining the 2025 Exam Cycle
* **Breast Cancer Screening Starts at 40**: The USPSTF (April 2024) now recommends biennial mammography for all average-risk women aged 40 to 74, replacing the old "individualized decision" model for ages 40-49 [executive_summary[0]][1] [key_guideline_shifts_checklist.0.new_guideline[0]][1].
* **Colorectal Screening Starts at 45**: The starting age for average-risk adults has lowered to 45 (Grade B), with the AAFP noting insufficient evidence for this specific 45-49 age group, creating a prime "shared decision-making" exam scenario [executive_summary[2]][2] [guideline_discrepancies_summary.recommendation_1[0]][2].
* **Lung Cancer Screening Widens to 50/20**: Eligibility now begins at age 50 (down from 55) and requires only a 20 pack-year history (down from 30), capturing a much larger high-risk cohort [executive_summary[3]][3] [key_guideline_shifts_checklist.2.new_guideline[0]][4].
* **Pneumococcal Vaccination Drops to Age 50**: A major 2025 update lowers the routine age-based recommendation from 65 to 50 years. For vaccine-naïve adults, a single dose of PCV20 or PCV21 is now the preferred "one-and-done" strategy [executive_summary[4]][5] [adult_immunization_algorithms.0.key_pitfall_or_update[0]][6].
* **RSV Vaccination is Risk-Stratified**: New guidance targets adults ≥75, and those 50-74 at increased risk. Crucially, for pregnant individuals, only Pfizer’s Abrysvo is recommended seasonally between 32 and 36 weeks gestation to protect the infant [executive_summary[5]][7] [adult_immunization_algorithms.2.special_populations[0]][8].

## 1. 7-Day Win Plan: Focus on Guaranteed Points

To maximize your score in the final week, prioritize the "New Normals" where exam writers focus on distinguishing updated knowledge from outdated practice.

### Daily Targets That Compound Score
* **Days 1–2: The Big 5 Screening Algorithms**: Lock in the new cutoffs for Breast (40), Colon (45), Lung (50/20PY), Cervical (hrHPV primary), and Osteoporosis (65).
* **Day 3: Adult Immunization**: Master the "Age 50" pivot for Shingles and Pneumococcal, and the specific pregnancy window for RSV.
* **Day 4: STI & Infectious Disease**: Focus on site-specific screening (rectal/pharyngeal) for MSM and the 2025 removal of COVID-19 from the nationally notifiable list.
* **Day 5: Biostats-in-Practice**: Differentiate Lead-time bias (survival artifact) from true mortality benefit.
* **Day 6: Ethics & Communication**: Drill the "Presumptive Recommendation" → "Ask-Tell-Ask" workflow for vaccine refusal.
* **Day 7: The "Trap" Review**: Review the "Old Guideline" distractors (e.g., Colonoscopy at 50, Zostavax) one last time.

## 2. The Big 5 Cancer Screening Algorithms

The most common error is selecting an outdated starting age or stopping rule. Use this table to anchor your decision-making.

### High-Yield Screening Matrix

| Cancer | Target Population | Start Age | Stop Age | Modality & Interval | Outdated Trap to Avoid |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Breast** | Cisgender women, average risk | **40** [cancer_screening_algorithms.0.start_age[0]][9] | **74** (I statement for ≥75) [cancer_screening_algorithms.0.stop_age[0]][9] | **Mammography q2y** [cancer_screening_algorithms.0.modality_and_interval[0]][9] | Starting at 50; ordering MRI for dense breasts without specific high-risk factors [cancer_screening_algorithms.0.outdated_guideline_trap[0]][9]. |
| **Colorectal** | Average-risk adults | **45** [cancer_screening_algorithms.1.start_age[0]][10] | **75** (76-85 is individualized) [cancer_screening_algorithms.1.stop_age[0]][10] | Colonoscopy q10y, FIT q1y, or CT Colonography q5y [cancer_screening_algorithms.1.modality_and_interval[0]][10] | Waiting until 50; failing to follow up a positive stool test with colonoscopy. |
| **Lung** | Smokers/Quitters <15y ago | **50** [cancer_screening_algorithms.2.start_age[0]][11] | **80** (or >15y since quit) [cancer_screening_algorithms.2.stop_age[0]][11] | **Annual Low-Dose CT** (LDCT) [cancer_screening_algorithms.2.modality_and_interval[0]][11] | Using old 55yo/30PY criteria; ordering CXR [cancer_screening_algorithms.2.outdated_guideline_trap[0]][3]. |
| **Cervical** | Individuals with cervix | **21** [cancer_screening_algorithms.3.start_age[0]][12] | **65** (if adequate prior negatives) [cancer_screening_algorithms.3.stop_age[0]][13] | 21-29: Pap q3y. **30-65: Primary hrHPV q5y** (preferred) or Co-test q5y [cancer_screening_algorithms.3.modality_and_interval[0]][13] | Annual Pap; screening <21; screening after hysterectomy for benign disease. |
| **Osteoporosis** | Postmenopausal women | **65** (or <65 w/ risk) | Individualized | **DXA Scan** | Screening men routinely; screening <65 without FRAX risk assessment. |

**Strategic Insight**: For **Prostate Cancer**, the USPSTF recommendation is Grade C for men 55-69 (individualized decision) and Grade D (do not screen) for men ≥70. The correct answer is never "Order PSA" without a discussion of risks (incontinence, impotence) vs. benefits.

## 3. Adult Immunization Algorithms

The "Age 50" threshold is the new critical pivot point for adult vaccination, replacing the old "Age 65" heuristic for pneumococcal coverage.

### Vaccine Decision Matrix

| Vaccine | Target Group | Dosing Schedule | Key Pitfall / Update |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pneumococcal** | **Adults ≥50**; 19-49 w/ risk [adult_immunization_algorithms.0.target_population[0]][14] | **Naïve**: Single dose **PCV20 or PCV21** completes series. If PCV15 used, follow w/ PPSV23 ≥1y later [adult_immunization_algorithms.0.dosing_schedule[0]][5] | **Update**: Age lowered to 50. **Pitfall**: Giving PPSV23 after PCV20/21 (not indicated) [adult_immunization_algorithms.0.key_pitfall_or_update[0]][6]. |
| **Zoster (Shingles)** | **Adults ≥50**; ≥19 if immunocompromised [adult_immunization_algorithms.1.target_population[0]][15] | **RZV (Shingrix) 2 doses**, 2-6 mo apart (1-2 mo if immunocompromised) [adult_immunization_algorithms.1.dosing_schedule[0]][16] | **Pitfall**: Waiting for age 60; using live Zostavax (discontinued). RZV is safe for immunocompromised [adult_immunization_algorithms.1.key_pitfall_or_update[0]][15]. |
| **RSV** | **Adults ≥75**; 50-74 w/ risk; Pregnant (32-36w) [adult_immunization_algorithms.2.target_population[0]][7] | Single dose (not annual) [adult_immunization_algorithms.2.dosing_schedule[0]][7] | **Pitfall**: Giving RSV vaccine to pregnant patient outside **32-36 weeks** or using non-Abrysvo product [adult_immunization_algorithms.2.key_pitfall_or_update[0]][8]. |
| **Tdap** | All adults (booster q10y); **Every Pregnancy** [adult_immunization_algorithms.4.target_population[0]][17] | 1 dose Tdap, then Td/Tdap q10y. **Pregnancy**: 1 dose Tdap at 27-36w **every** pregnancy [adult_immunization_algorithms.4.special_populations[0]][17] | **Pitfall**: Skipping Tdap in pregnancy because patient had one recently. Must give **every** pregnancy for fetal immunity [adult_immunization_algorithms.4.key_pitfall_or_update[0]][17]. |
| **HPV** | Routine thru 26; 27-45 Shared Decision | 2 doses (start <15); 3 doses (start ≥15 or immunocompromised) [adult_immunization_algorithms.5.dosing_schedule[0]][17] | **Pitfall**: Treating it as routine for 27-45 (it's shared decision-making due to lower benefit) [adult_immunization_algorithms.5.key_pitfall_or_update[0]][17]. |

## 4. STI Screening Protocols

Screening is driven by anatomy and risk behavior, not just identity.

* **Chlamydia/Gonorrhea**:
 * **Women <25**: Annual screening recommended [sti_screening_protocols.screening_recommendation[0]][18].
 * **Pregnant Women**: Screen at first prenatal visit; retest in 3rd trimester if at risk. **Test of Cure** required for Chlamydia (4 weeks post-treatment) [sti_screening_protocols.special_considerations[0]][19].
 * **MSM**: Annual screening at **all sites of contact** (urethral, rectal, pharyngeal). High-risk MSM (e.g., on PrEP) may need screening every 3-6 months [sti_screening_protocols.screening_recommendation[0]][18].
* **Heterosexual Men**: Routine screening is **not** recommended for asymptomatic, low-risk men [sti_screening_protocols.screening_recommendation[0]][18].

## 5. Biostats-in-Practice: Screening Bias

Exam vignettes often present "improved survival" data to trap you into selecting a screening test that doesn't actually save lives.

* **Lead-Time Bias**: Screening detects disease earlier, lengthening the time from diagnosis to death *without* changing the date of death.
 * *Red Flag*: "5-year survival increased from 5% to 25%" but mortality rate is unchanged [screening_bias_toolkit.vignette_example[0]][20].
 * *Correct Endpoint*: **Disease-specific mortality** is the only valid metric for screening effectiveness [screening_bias_toolkit.exam_takeaway[0]][21].
* **Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV)**:
 * *Formula*: $NNV = 1 / ARR$ where $ARR = CER - EER$.
 * *Example*: If Shingrix reduces risk from 0.0092 (CER) to 0.0008 (EER), $ARR = 0.0084$. $NNV = 1 / 0.0084 \approx 119$ [biostatistics_in_practice.worked_example_summary[0]][22].

## 6. Ethics & Communication: The "Refusal" Algorithm

When a patient refuses a vaccine, the correct answer is never to dismiss them from practice.

1. **Presumptive Recommendation**: Start with "You are due for your Tdap today" rather than "Do you want...?" [ethics_and_communication_guide.recommended_action[0]][23].
2. **Explore Concerns**: If refused, use "Ask-Tell-Ask" to understand specific barriers [ethics_and_communication_guide.recommended_action[0]][23].
3. **Benevolent Persuasion**: Provide targeted information without coercion.
4. **Documentation**: If refusal persists, document the discussion (e.g., Refusal to Vaccinate form) and maintain the therapeutic relationship [ethics_and_communication_guide.recommended_action[0]][23].
5. **Avoid**: Dismissing the patient from the practice is considered inappropriate by CDC/AAFP [ethics_and_communication_guide.action_to_avoid[0]][23].

## 7. Notifiable Diseases Update (2025)

* **COVID-19 Change**: As of 2025, COVID-19 is **no longer a nationally notifiable condition** to the CDC [notifiable_diseases_update.change_summary[0]][24].
* **Clinical Implication**: Reporting requirements now depend entirely on **state/local jurisdiction** laws (e.g., Michigan still requires reporting). In vignettes, look for "Follow local health department guidelines" rather than automatic national reporting [notifiable_diseases_update.clinical_relevance[0]][25].

## 8. Vignette Production Pipeline: Batch 1 (1-10)

These vignettes target the "Guaranteed Points" in Adult Immunization and Cancer Screening.

### Vignette #1: Breast Cancer Screening - Preventive
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 42-year-old asymptomatic woman presents for a routine health maintenance visit. She has no family history of breast cancer and no personal history of high-risk breast lesions. She asks when she should start getting mammograms.

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate recommendation** for this patient regarding breast cancer screening?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** Individualize the decision to screen after a discussion of risks and benefits, as routine screening is typically recommended to start at age 50.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is a woman aged 42, falling squarely within the new 40-to-74-year age bracket for routine screening established in 2024 [preventive_medicine_vignettes.0.key_risk_factor[0]][1].
* **The Correct Action:** Recommend biennial screening mammography starting now [preventive_medicine_vignettes.0.correct_action[0]][26].
* **The "USPSTF Law":** The USPSTF (April 2024) gives a Grade B recommendation for biennial screening mammography for all average-risk women aged 40 to 74 years [preventive_medicine_vignettes.0.guideline_reference[0]][26].

### Vignette #2: Lung Cancer Screening - Preventive
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 58-year-old man comes for a checkup. His medical history is notable for hypertension. He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 25 years and quit 10 years ago. He reports no cough, hemoptysis, or unintentional weight loss.

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate next step** in management for this patient's preventive care?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** No screening is indicated as his pack-year history is less than 30.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient meets all three criteria: age 50-80 (he is 58), has a ≥20 pack-year history (he has 25), and quit <15 years ago (he quit 10 years ago) [preventive_medicine_vignettes.1.key_risk_factor[0]][11].
* **The Correct Action:** Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest [preventive_medicine_vignettes.1.correct_action[0]][11].
* **The "USPSTF Law":** The USPSTF (2021) recommends annual LDCT screening for adults aged 50 to 80 years with a ≥20 pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years [preventive_medicine_vignettes.1.guideline_reference[0]][11].

### Vignette #3: Colorectal Cancer Screening - Preventive
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 46-year-old asymptomatic man with no family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease presents for a routine physical exam. He asks about what cancer screenings he should be getting.

* **The "Stump" Question:** According to the **most current USPSTF guidelines**, what is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** Advise him to begin screening at age 50 with a colonoscopy every 10 years.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is an average-risk adult aged 46, falling into the expanded 45-49 screening bracket.
* **The Correct Action:** Recommend initiating screening now with an appropriate modality, such as an annual Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) or a colonoscopy every 10 years [preventive_medicine_vignettes.2.correct_action[0]][2].
* **The "USPSTF Law":** The USPSTF (2021) recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 45 to 75 years (Grade B for ages 45-49, Grade A for ages 50-75) [preventive_medicine_vignettes.2.guideline_reference[0]][2].

### Vignette #4: Zoster Vaccination - Preventive (Immunization)
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 52-year-old healthy woman comes for a routine visit. She has no significant medical history. She recalls receiving the 'shingles shot' about 5 years ago but is unsure which one. She asks if she needs any further vaccination.

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate recommendation** regarding zoster vaccination for this patient?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** No further vaccination is needed as she is already vaccinated against zoster and is under the age of 60.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is over 50 years old, making her eligible for the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV). Prior vaccination with the old live vaccine (ZVL, Zostavax) does not preclude RZV administration.
* **The Correct Action:** Recommend a two-dose series of the recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix).
* **The "USPSTF Law":** The ACIP recommends a 2-dose series of RZV for all immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older, regardless of prior history of herpes zoster or previous vaccination with the live zoster vaccine (ZVL).

### Vignette #5: Pneumococcal Vaccination - Preventive (Immunization)
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 68-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents for a check-up. His vaccination records are unavailable, and he cannot recall ever receiving a 'pneumonia shot.'

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate pneumococcal vaccination strategy** for this patient today?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** Administer PPSV23 now, followed by PCV13 one year later.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is a pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adult over 65 years old, qualifying him for the current, simplified conjugate vaccine pathway.
* **The Correct Action:** Administer a single dose of PCV20 or PCV21 to complete his pneumococcal vaccination.
* **The "USPSTF Law":** For pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults aged ≥65 years (and now ≥50), the ACIP recommends a single dose of PCV20 or PCV21, OR a single dose of PCV15 followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year later.

### Vignette #6: Prostate Cancer Screening - Preventive (Ethics)
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 60-year-old asymptomatic African American man comes for a health maintenance visit. He says, 'My friend was just diagnosed with prostate cancer, I think I should get checked with that PSA test.' He has no family history of prostate cancer.

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate next step** in management?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** Order a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level immediately.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is in the 55-69 age range where screening is a Grade C recommendation, mandating a discussion. His status as a Black man puts him at higher risk, making the discussion even more critical.
* **The Correct Action:** Engage in a shared decision-making discussion, explaining the potential small benefit of screening versus the more common and significant harms of false positives, overdiagnosis, and treatment complications.
* **The "USPSTF Law":** For men aged 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF recommends that the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening should be an individual one (Grade C).

### Vignette #7: Tdap Vaccination in Pregnancy - Preventive (Immunization)
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 30-year-old G2P1 woman at 29 weeks gestation presents for a routine prenatal visit. Her records show she received a Tdap vaccine during her first pregnancy 3 years ago. She asks if she needs another 'whooping cough shot.'

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate recommendation** for this patient?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** No Tdap is needed as she received one within the last 10 years.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is pregnant and currently within the optimal window (27-36 weeks) for Tdap administration to maximize passive antibody transfer to the fetus.
* **The Correct Action:** Administer one dose of Tdap now.
* **The "USPSTF Law":** The ACIP recommends one dose of Tdap during EACH pregnancy, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation, regardless of the patient's prior history of receiving Tdap.

### Vignette #8: RSV Vaccination - Preventive (Immunization)
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 67-year-old man with a history of COPD presents in September for his annual physical. He is up-to-date on his other immunizations. He asks about the new RSV vaccine he saw advertised on television.

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate recommendation** regarding RSV vaccination for this patient?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** RSV vaccination is only for infants and is not recommended for adults.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is over 60 years old and has a chronic lung condition (COPD), which places him at increased risk for severe RSV disease.
* **The Correct Action:** Recommend a single dose of an RSV vaccine (e.g., Arexvy, Abrysvo, or mResvia) based on shared clinical decision-making.
* **The "USPSTF Law":** The ACIP recommends a single dose of RSV vaccine for adults aged ≥60 years using shared clinical decision-making, especially for those with chronic medical conditions.

### Vignette #9: Osteoporosis Screening - Preventive
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 68-year-old woman presents for her annual wellness visit. She has no history of fractures, does not smoke, and has a normal BMI. She feels well and takes no chronic medications.

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate screening test** to recommend for this patient?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** No screening is needed as she is asymptomatic and has no specific risk factors.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is a woman aged 68. Age alone (≥65 years) is the indication for screening, regardless of other risk factors [preventive_medicine_vignettes.8.key_risk_factor[0]][27].
* **The Correct Action:** Recommend a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan [preventive_medicine_vignettes.8.correct_action[0]][28].
* **The "USPSTF Law":** The USPSTF (2025) recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing in all women aged 65 years and older (Grade B) [preventive_medicine_vignettes.8.guideline_reference[0]][27].

### Vignette #10: Cervical Cancer Screening - Preventive
> **The Real-World Stem:** A 35-year-old woman presents for her well-woman exam. Her last Pap test was 3 years ago and was normal. She has been in a monogamous relationship for 10 years. She asks what screening she needs today.

* **The "Stump" Question:** What is the **most appropriate screening strategy** to offer this patient?
* **The "Old Guideline" Trap (Distractor):** Perform an annual Pap test and HPV co-test.
* **The "Risk-Guard" (Key Spotter):** The patient is in the 30-65 age group, where screening intervals have been extended to 5 years with the inclusion of HPV testing [preventive_medicine_vignettes.9.key_risk_factor[0]][29].
* **The Correct Action:** Offer primary hrHPV testing alone every 5 years or co-testing (hrHPV + cytology) every 5 years. Cytology alone every 3 years remains an acceptable alternative [preventive_medicine_vignettes.9.correct_action[0]][29].
* **The "USPSTF Law":** For women aged 30-65, the USPSTF recommends screening with cytology alone every 3 years, primary hrHPV testing alone every 5 years, or co-testing every 5 years [preventive_medicine_vignettes.9.guideline_reference[0]][29].
